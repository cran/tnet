Description: Binary ties limit the richness of network analyses as relations are unique. The two-mode structure contains a number of features lost when projection it to a one-mode network. Longitudinal datasets allow for an understanding of the causal relationship among ties, which is not the case in cross-sectional datasets as ties are dependent upon each other.
